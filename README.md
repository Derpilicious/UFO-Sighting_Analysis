An exploratory data analysis project made for my Introduction to Data Science class. 

Uses R tidyverse libraries to clean and reformat data about UFO sightings. Includes extensive annotations and explanations about what was being done. Also included hypothesis questions that was the subject of my visualization plots (done in ggplot2) and concluding statements. 

Got an A+ in the course ðŸ˜Ž
